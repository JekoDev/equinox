  Word1: Chaos
  Word2: Destruction
  Word3: Change
  Meaning1: chaos finds you in a dream. or maybe you're awake. it has many eyes.
    it's the most beautiful thing you've ever seen. you reach out to it and let it
    unravel you. when you wake up, your fingertips are burned and stained with color.
    be careful.
  Meaning2: a shattering mirror. a broken bone. a crack in your favorite mug. everything
    is falling apart. your world is build on lies. the lies unravel. what is underneath
    won't be pretty. you will not like it. neither will they.
  Meaning3: you will feel comfortable. then everything will change. this is a threat.
    it will come when you least expect it. make three steps back, turn around and
    run while everything falls apart in the background. rebuild something from the
    ashes.
