  Word1: Illusion
  Word2: Anxiety
  Word3: Intuition
  Meaning1: 'the moon is lying to you. the earth is lying to you. everyone is lying
    to you. the words don''t make sense anymore. the letters dissolve in front of
    your eyes. stop thinking. stop feeding the illusions. they will eat you alive. '
  Meaning2: your hands haven't stopped shaking in years. maybe they have always been
    shaking. you're terrified, but you don't know what you're afraid of. you are
    your own worst enemy, but you don't know that yet. you never will.
  Meaning3: 'the night is dark and starless. you can''t see your path, but you''re
    treading along it nonetheless. is there even a path? are you even walking? move
    slowly. stop your thoughts and trust only your feet. the night has become even
    darker. '
