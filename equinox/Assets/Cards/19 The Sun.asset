  Word1: Positivity
  Word2: Radiance
  Word3: Success
  Meaning1: good things happen. they might not happen to you, but somewhere in the
    world, something good is happening right now. maybe to your worst enemy. don't
    worry - good things will find you too. they are coming. they are hungry.
  Meaning2: you're radiant. you're shining. you're blinding. no one can look at you
    because their eyes start steaming until all they can see is white light. you
    burn everything you touch, but that's okay, because the sun does that too.
  Meaning3: look up. no, not that far up, that is the sky, and we don't want to be
    looking at the sky right now. there are a lot of good things around you. like
    that tall, looming figure behind that tree, just out of sight. it really likes
    you. go, make them proud.
