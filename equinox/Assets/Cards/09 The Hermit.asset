  Word1: Solitude
  Word2: Retreat
  Word3: Take your time
  Meaning1: you will die alone. you are alone right now. you're in a room full of
    people. you could be in space, alone among the stars and it wouldn't matter.
    the stars would scream to you. they are always screaming.
  Meaning2: now is the perfect time to buy a cabin in the woods! leave behind the
    buzzing street life and run. run faster. they will find you. didn't you always
    wanted to be a horror movie protagonist? good luck!
  Meaning3: the world is turning too fast for you anyway. stop trying to catch up.
    instead, make yourself a cup of tea. sprinkle some teeth in there. they make
    an excellent enhancement to the flavor. tea always helps. teeth, too.
