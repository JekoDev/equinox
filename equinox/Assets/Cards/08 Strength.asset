  Word1: Inner Strength
  Word2: Balance
  Word3: Endure
  Meaning1: someone is looking at you. believe in yourself, they tell you, and smile.
    their smile has too many teeth. it unsettles you. don't rely on brute force,
    they tell you. trust your own power. they might be saying it to save their teeth.
    you're not sure.
  Meaning2: the moon is up in the sky, full and round. like a coin. you want to howl
    at it. dig your teeth into the coin. trade the moon an emotion of your choice
    and walk away. isn't that what people say when they talk about balance?
  Meaning3: 'find a table of your choice and cover under it. it will all be over
    soon. wrap your arms around your chest and feel your body shaking. you''re still
    alive. you will come out of this alive. you will come out of it either way. '
