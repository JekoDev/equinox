  Meaning1: 'everything good always starts with an idea. so does everything bad.
    do you have an idea? is it dangerous? are you sure it is not dangerous? hold
    it like a knife. don''t stab yourself in the process. move on. '
  Meaning2: stop losing your head. seriously, the blood gets everywhere and it's
    always a mess. pick it up again, please. ensure it stays firmly attached to your
    neck. the next time, no one might be around to fix you up again.
  Meaning3: 'all creation is magic. all magic is science. all science is a feeble
    concept made up in a fever dream. don''t worry - creation is the closest you''ll
    ever get to magic. do worry - magic is terrifying thing. '
