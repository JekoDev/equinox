  Word1: New beginnings
  Word2: Leap of Faith
  Word3: Innocence
  Meaning1: 'Something is beginning. There is always something beginning. pick a
    beginning. Any beginning. Is it about you? Congratulations, it now is. Here''s
    the thing with beginnings: they never care if you want them.'
  Meaning2: 'it''s a long way down to the end of your journey. have you ever wondered
    about jumping? you might grow wings on the way down. or not. it will still get
    you somewhere, i figure. a metaphorical leap is fine. '
  Meaning3: are you wondering about your own innocence? don't worry, it's still there
    - right next to the dark stain three inches above your heart. innocence is like
    bleach. use it wisely. don't try to drink it. it would probably kill you.
