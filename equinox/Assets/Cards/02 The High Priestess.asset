  Word1: Intuition
  Word2: Knowledge
  Word3: Be still
  Meaning1: you're at a crossroads. on the left side, there's a thunderstorm brewing
    over a plain. on the right side, an everlasting ocean, dark and grey. pick a
    side. trust your inner organs. you will make the wrong choice. it will be fine.
  Meaning2: nothing is as it seems. you know that. make this the only knowledge you
    ever need. the world is a web of lies and deceit. what can you do about it? nothing.
    just live with the everlasting dread of your knowledge.
  Meaning3: stop moving, or they will find you. don't make a sound. don't breathe.
    you'll be here for a while. something inside of you will still be moving. listen
    to that. listen real closely. closer. come a little closer.
