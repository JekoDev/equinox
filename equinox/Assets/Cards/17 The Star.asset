  Word1: Hope
  Word2: Healing
  Word3: Purpose
  Meaning1: look up to the stars in the sky. unblinking. everlasting. eternal. cold.
    they could destroy worlds. they are destroyed worlds. doesn't that make you feel
    hopeful? trust the stars and their glowing patterns that hypnotize you. they
    are friendly. i think.
  Meaning2: you have suffered through a lot. the world knows that. your mother knows
    that. your dog knows it. your neighbours and your boss, too. they won't be understanding
    of your attempts to heal, but fuck them. do it anyway.
  Meaning3: to quote a famous work of literature - it is not in the stars to hold
    our destiny, but in ourselves. books have always lied to you. look up to the
    stars. try jumping high enough to hold onto them. try as many times as you have
    to. you might fly one day.
