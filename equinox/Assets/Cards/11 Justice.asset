  Word1: Judge
  Word2: Jury
  Word3: Executioner
  Meaning1: the judge is a scale. your reflection shows in the gold, but it has no
    eyes. climb onto the scale. there's an ocean of black waves under you. tear your
    heart out of your chest and place it on the other scale. i hope it will be light.
  Meaning2: the jury is an ocean of people. dressed in black robes. no faces. when
    they speak, they speak as one voice. they will ask you what you have done. you
    will tell them your life story even though you don't want to. don't lie. they
    will know.
  Meaning3: the executioner is a sword, pale and transparent. wielded by no one.
    judgement will come upon you. accept it. stand with your decisions. you deserve
    the outcome, no matter what the outcome will be.
