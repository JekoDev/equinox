  Word1: Willpower
  Word2: Control
  Word3: Be Bold
  Meaning1: you have discovered how to make decisions. good for you! you will need
    them. pick a thing. any thing. take it, it's yours now. run. maybe you stole
    it, but just believe it's yours. no one can take that from you, can they?
  Meaning2: a chariot rolls down a hill. the driver is scared. there is no punchline,
    just a crashed chariot. do you know what losing control looks like? neither do
    i. focus on the punchline. go.
  Meaning3: 'look at the easy route. look at it. now avert your eyes. don''t look
    back. they will know if you attempt to cut corners. keep your eyes fixed onto
    your path. you never know what lurks beside it. '
