  Word1: Completion
  Word2: Travel
  Word3: Entirety
  Meaning1: something is ending. something is always ending. pick an ending. any
    ending. is it about you? congratulations, it now is. or maybe the story wasn't
    about you all along. are you sure you were the protagonist of your own life?
  Meaning2: you have come a long way. you will still go a long way from here on.
    this feels like an end, but it's merely a completion of something. closure. close
    the lid of the chest and never open it again. find the most secure lock you can
    find. use it.
  Meaning3: entirety and entity share a lot of letters. curious, isn't it? you are
    unbecoming and becoming something at the same time. you have almost completed
    the process. good job. we ensure you that you won't regret it. you are very close.
