  Word1: Shadow
  Word2: Restraints
  Word3: Addiction
  Meaning1: some people are born without a shadow. they don't last long. your shadow
    hides under your bed and holds your hand while you sleep. it looms over you and
    watches you breathe, imitating the breaths. one day, it will replace you. today
    is not the day.
  Meaning2: look down to your wrists. do you see the chains? no? alright, so they
    are invisible chains. focus. imagine them. craft them in your mind. make them
    real. metal and steel and the heavy weight. now break them. how? i don't know,
    find out.
  Meaning3: everyone is addicted to something. other people. being alive. cigarettes.
    collecting taxidermy. it always comes back to haunt you. especially the taxidermy.
    it will cause you a lot of pain in the future. burn it. now.
