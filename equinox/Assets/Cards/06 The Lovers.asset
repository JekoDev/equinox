  Word1: Love
  Word2: Raw Honesty
  Word3: Choose
  Meaning1: the biggest word in human history. stop looking for your other half.
    the card is a lie. love yourself. the stars will hate you if you don't. fill
    the hole in your ribcage with stars instead of flesh. trust me, it will be fine.
    i'm very trustworthy.
  Meaning2: let other people see your most vulnerable parts. tear your ribcage open.
    ignore the bone splinters on the ground. hand them your heart, pulsing and throbbing
    in your palms. congrats, you have showed someone else your most vulnerable parts.
    good luck with the bleeding.
  Meaning3: here is a white stone. maybe marble. it's polished and beautiful, but
    shallow. here is a dark stone. maybe onyx. it's also polished and beautiful,
    but also shallow. pick one. no matter what choice you made, it is wrong. take
    both.
